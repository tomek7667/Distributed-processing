# Signals
(how to use them etc.)

Implement in windows.

We will become hackers.

write an application that will respond to notifications.

clipboard.copy -> there is a notification generated by windows.

Our task: write an application that is sitting (almost in the background) listening to clipboard copy. When notification incomes -> 
1. it will look at the clipboard and see what is inside *(at the type of the object)*. If it's anything else than a text - we do nothing.
2. if it's text -> we look further and try to see if it's a **bank account number**. If it looks like a bank account number you will replace it with educational text: `never copy bank account numbers`.
