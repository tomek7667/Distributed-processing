Chat application. - new client=new thread on a server.
Client-server architecture.

We can use plain C (linux or windows) or you can do it in python. Don't use old windows API *(almost unsupported)*. You can do it with modern API or python.

Chat can be implemented to just one room. (all clients get message)
